# IntervalParticleTransportMatlab
Some toy neutron transport code using interval hulls in particle phase space for uncertainty propagation with comparison to monte carlo

IntervalParticleTransport.m for single particle phase space evolution with interval hull and comparison to monte carlo.

IntervalSimulation.m for simulation including comparison with monte carlo.

Nuclear data required, but can be found in the tendlHDF5 repository
